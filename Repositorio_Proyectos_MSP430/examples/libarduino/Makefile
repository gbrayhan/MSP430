# Source files and target binary, define your source files here to have them
# compiled, and define the target basename. BUILD defines the default build
# type, as either "lib" or "bin". If bin, an .elf binary will be created as
# well as a .hex file, and if lib an .a library file will be created. To have
# the binary flashed on the device after build, use "bin prog".
