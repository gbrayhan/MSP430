 * @param pbuf  Pointer to a pointer to character set by the caller to
 *        to address of the inital character buffer, or 0 of no such
 *        buffer exists. The function sets the pointer to a the address
 *        of the dynamically allocated character buffer, or leaves it
 *        unchanged if it doesn't allocate any buffer.
 * @param pbufsize  Pointer to a size_t set by the caller to the size of
 *        the inital character buffer. The function sets the value pointed
 *        to by this argument to the size of the dynamically allocated
 *        character buffer, or leaves it unchanged if it doesn't allocate
 *        any buffer.

 *        %m           the value of strerror(errno)

 *        %{:}         else clause
 *        %{;}         end of if/else clause
 *
 *        %{Ac}        quoted array of narrow characters
 *        %{*Ac}       quoted array of characters of width '*' each
 *                     where '*' is an int argument extracted from
 *                     the argument list
 *        %{#s}        quoted narrow character string
 *        %{#ls}       quoted wide character string
 *        %{$envvar}   value of an environment variable envvar
 *        %{f}         function pointer
 *        %{K}         signal name (such as "SIGABRT")
