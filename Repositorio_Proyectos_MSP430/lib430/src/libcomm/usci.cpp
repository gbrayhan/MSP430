/**
 * usci_serial.cpp - simple example using USCI UART + ringbuffer + command line monitor
 *
 * This code was written to test the new uniarch version of msp430-gcc. I wanted
 * to make sure it could generate code for the msp430g2553 running on the TI
 * launchpad.
 *
 * This code mplements a command line interface over the USB-CDC serial at
 * 9600-8-N-1. To test you must swap the RX/TX pins on your launchpad to use
 * the hardware USCI UART.  I disconnected those jumpers on my launchpad and used
 * a couple of F-M jumper wires to run the msp430g2553 from a breadboard.
 * P1.1=RXD and P1.2=TXD ( this is the opposite of the msp430g2231 default setup )
 *
 * * License: Do with this code what you want. However, don't blame
 * me if you connect it to a heart pump and it stops.  This source
 * is provided as is with no warranties. It probably has bugs!!
 * You have been warned!
