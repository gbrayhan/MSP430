# This script makes use of mspdebug to identify and program the device. If it
# is located in a location outside of the path, change the following line to
# point to the proper location. Also, the driver is defined here:
#
MSPDEBUG = mspdebug
MSPTYPE  = rf2500
#
# The MCU to use can either be defined on the command line:
#   export MCU=msp430g2253
# Or explicitly defined in the makefile:
#   MCU=msp430g2553
# Or the preferred way, have it reported by mspdebug:
#
MCU?=$(shell $(MSPDEBUG) -q $(MSPTYPE) "exit" 2>/dev/null | grep -i "Device:" | cut -c 9- | tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]")
#
# Source files and target binary, define your source files here to have them
# compiled, and define the target basename. BUILD defines the default build
# type, as either "lib" or "bin". If bin, an .elf binary will be created as
# well as a .hex file, and if lib an .a library file will be created. To have
# the binary flashed on the device after build, use "bin prog".
