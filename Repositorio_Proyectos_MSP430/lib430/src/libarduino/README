# libArduino [lib430]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now it is possible to write your code with the same simplicity as with the
Arduino. This is the Arduinoish SDK component of *lib430*. It allows you to 
implement your program much like an Arduino sketch. Functions are provided
that look and feel familiar to Android developers.

## Differences

 * Since the MSP430 with GCC is limited to C at this time, only C-syntax can
   be used. This means that objects aren't available in the same way.

## Compiling

Compile lib430 with the makefile such as:

    MCU=msp430g2553 make lib

Then copy the .a file as well as the include files to your desired location.
Or you can use `chef` in the *lib430* root folder to build for your desired
targets.

### Linking with

If you used `chef` and the *[mspdev Makefile][1]* (with [common.mk][2]) you should be good with just adding
`-larduino` to the libraries define in the Makefile. This will get you all the
loop-wrapping goodness, but you of course also need to `#include <arduino.h>`
for things to work as intended.

## Using libArduino

 * libArduino makes use of the WDT to count the uptime with a granlarity of
   100Âµs. This means you can not, and should not use the watchdog timer in
   your applications.
 * `#include <arduino.h>` in your source code, add `-larduino` your GCC
   command line to link with the library.
 * Define your own `main()` and `loop()` methods.

### Constants

The following constants are defined to aid when working with digital IO

 * `LOW`
 * `HIGH`
 * `INPUT`
 * `OUTPUT`
	
### Variable types

The following variable types have been mapped to the appropriate MSP vartypes:

 * `WORD` as `unsigned int` _(2 bytes)_
 * `byte` as `unsigned char` _(1 byte)_

### Digital I/O

Methods to do digital I/O to be compatible with the Arduino SDK.

 * `inline void pinMode(int pin, int isOutput)`
 * `inline void digitalWrite(WORD pin, WORD setOrReset)`
 * `inline int digitalRead(WORD pin)`

### Control Functions

Methods to control the MCU to be compatible with the Arduino SDK.

 * `void delayMicroseconds(unsigned int time)`
 * `void delayMicrosecondszz(unsigned int time)`
 * `inline void delayMilliseconds(unsigned int delay)`

### Stubs

 * `main()` stub, making use of `loop()` and `setup()`.

## Changelog

### 27 jan 2012

 * Added support for `millis()` and `micros()`. `uptime_init()` is called before
   `loop()`
