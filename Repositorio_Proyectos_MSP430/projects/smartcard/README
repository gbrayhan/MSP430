SmartCard Interface
===================

This project contains a generic framework for writing smartcard-oriented
applications for the msp430. It comes with support for the ISO standard
smart cards.

## Interfacing

You can interface with the smart card reader over SPI. This requires a total
of three pins, MISO, MOSI and CLK. 

The first byte is always a command byte, 8 bits, holding the following
values:

 * cmd:0 - Read (0) or write (1)
 * cmd:1 - Burst mode (1) or byte mode (0)
 * cmd:2..6 - Reserved
 * cmd:7 - Burst read - must be the only bit set.

These constants are defined as:

 * `CMD_READ 0x00` and `CMD_WRITE 0x01`
 * `CMD_BURST_MODE 0x02`
 * `CMD_BURST_READ 0x80`

### Reading from a smart card

 1. Send `sccom_send(CMD_READ | CMD_BURST_MODE, "file:path")`
 2. Repeatedly call `sccom_read(CMD_BURST_READ, &buffer, buffer_size, &read)` until `read` comes back as 0.
 3. Send `sccom_close();`
